              EventEase aims to simplify the planning and management of
              events.Event management is a process of organizing a professional
              and focused event, for a particular target audience. It involves
              visualizing concepts, planning, budgeting, organizing and
              executing events such as wedding, musical concerts, corporate
              seminars, exhibitions, birthday celebrations, theme parties, etc.
              Event Management is a multi-million-dollar industry, growing
              rapidly, with events hosted regularly. Event management is the
              application of project management to the creation and development
              of large-scale events. An event refers to a social gathering or
              activity, such as a festival(for example a musical festival), a
              ceremony( for example a marriage ) and a party(for example a
              birthday party).
